# 🛡️ Login Activity Report Generator (Python)

This Python script simulates a basic log analysis tool that scans login activity, detects failed attempts, flags known suspicious IP addresses, and generates a simple security report.

---

## ✅ What It Does

- Counts total login attempts  
- Separates successful vs. failed logins  
- Checks for known suspicious IPs  
- Triggers an alert if suspicious activity is detected  
- Prints a clean, readable summary report  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Input:
A list of fake log entries (could be adapted for real log files):
```python
logs = [
    "SUCCESS: user1 from 192.168.1.5",
    "FAILED: user2 from 10.0.0.99",
    "FAILED: root from 66.66.66.66",
    ...
]
```

### Logic:
- Uses `for` loops to scan each log line  
- Uses string checks (`"SUCCESS"` or `"FAILED"`) to classify outcomes  
- Cross-checks each log line against a list of known suspicious IPs  

### Output:
Example console output:
```
LOGIN REPORT
----------------
Total attempts: 6
Successful logins: 2
Failed logins: 4
Suspicious IPs detected: 2
⚠️ ALERT TRIGGERED
```

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- Load log data from an external file  
- Save the report as a `.txt` or `.csv`  
- Add timestamps or usernames  
- Use regular expressions for deeper pattern matching  
- Integrate into a larger incident response toolkit

## 🎯 Why This Project?

This tool was built as part of my **CompTIA Security+** and Python practice. It demonstrates:

- Real-world log analysis thinking  
- Secure coding and defensive scripting  
- Automation of repetitive detection tasks
